# Introduction
Hello 👋 everyone  ! I'm Kb, a  ```Generalist Unity Programmer``` who's still on a learning journey (we all are!)🕵️.
I've been diving into understanding different patterns for recognition in a simplified way, the more we find pattern the better we understand problem.   
🤩 I'm excited to share this project with you all ! It's currently in development for next blog 👨‍💻, but I'll be giving you updates as          
 things progress !
     


So Stay Tuned !! If you like my blog work ! 🤗

# About Project
> Different Approaches  For Highlighting Possible Moves for a Selected Chess Piece!
> 
  The ``` Aim ``` of the Project is  can we identify recurring patterns within a general behavior, without examining each action of chess pieces?


Now , Let see what we have in the bucket😋 , it is pretty simple you have to hop down on _**Controller gameobject**_
and during PlayMode you can control position of highlight and select chess piece that you wanted to instantiate .

# Perks 
- You can easily modify position of Highlight  through Inspector in Realtime(▶️) using slider.
- You can easily switch chess piece through inspector . 

# Downside
- While switching chess pieces you need to click  _**None**_ First then we can assigned.
- You can't remove chess piece once it instantiate !
- The Highlight overlapping other pieces 🫥.
