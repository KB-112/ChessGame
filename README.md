# About Project
Hello 👋 everyone  ! I'm Kb, a Unity programmer who's still on a learning journey (we all are!)🕵️. 
I've been diving into understanding different patterns for recognition in a simplified way, always striving to improve.  
I'm excited to share this project with you all soon! It's currently in development for next blog , but I'll be giving you updates as things progress.

So Stay Tuned !! If you like my blog work ! 🤗
