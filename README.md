# Introduction
Hello üëã everyone  ! I'm Kb, a **Generalist Unity programmer** who's still on a learning journey (we all are!)üïµÔ∏è. 
I've been diving into understanding different patterns for recognition in a simplified way, always striving to improve.  
I'm excited ü§© to share this project with you all ! It's currently in development for next blog , but I'll be giving you updates as things progress.

So Stay Tuned !! If you like my blog work ! ü§ó

# About Project
> Different Approaches  For Highlighting Possible Moves for a Selected Chess Piece!
> 
  The **Aim** of the Project is  can we identify recurring patterns within a general behavior, without examining each action of chess pieces?
  
Now , Let see what we have in the bucketüòã , it is pretty simple you have to hop down on **Controller gameobject**
and during PlayMode you can control position of highlight and select chess piece that you wanted to instantiate .

# Perks 
- You can easily modify position of Highlight  through Inspector in Realtime(‚ñ∂Ô∏è) using slider.
- You can easily switch chess piece thorugh inspector . 

# Downside
- While switching chess pieces you need to click **None** First then we can assigned.
- You can't remove chess piece once it instnaitate !
